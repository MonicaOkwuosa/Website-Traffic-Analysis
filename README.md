# Website-Traffic-Analysis
As a Data Analyst, deriving insights is one thing while delivering reports generated is another. This analysis is reported in order to give systematic breakdown of the tasks carried out using Microsoft Excel, steps taken and actions recommended to be taken in order to achieve website effectiveness.
## 1. Introduction
This review focuses on the initial analysis of a website traffic dataset to uncover key user   patterns and marketing insight. The dataset includes key metrics such as page views, session duration, conversion rate, bounce rate, time on page, previous visits and traffic sources. By examining these metrics, I aim to identify trends, patterns and anomalies in user engagement, offer insights into potential areas for improvement, factors influencing conversions and overall website performance. The data was explored using Excel for descriptive statistics and visualization.

## 2. Objective
The primary goal of this review is to conduct an exploratory analysis of the dataset and communicate findings through a structured technical report. Specifically, this report aims to:
1.	Identify Key Insights 
2.	Understand User Behavior
3.	Highlight Areas for Optimization
4.	To introduce exploratory data analysis (EDA)
5.	To Communicate Findings in a professional and actionable way
6.	Support Data-Driven Decision-Making

## 3. Observations
Initial Insights at first view: 
1.	The website dataset contains 2000 rows, 7 columns and each column as a unique(key) variable.
2.	The dataset contains both numerical (floats and integers) and categorically(string) data types.
3.	There are 5 traffic sources and not all traffic sources perform the same.
4.	Session duration ranges between 0.003 – 20minutes.
5.	Time on page ranges between 0.069 – 24.80minutes.
6.	There are new visitors on the site.
7.	Some page Views are zero (0) which could be as a result of no website traffic or tracking issues.

## 4.Key Insights
1.	Pages 4 and 5 are the most viewed pages with a maximum value of 354 counts respectively and each also has a distinct count of 51 and 41 of conversion rate respectively.

2.	Organic traffic source is the highest source with a count of 786.

3.	Most users who visited the site 2 times previously have the maximum sum of page views with a value of 2806 and 9 times previous users have a minimum sum of page views with a value of 6.

4.	Majority of the pages viewed have high bounce rates.

## 5. Recommendations and Conclusions
1.	High conversions from page views with low bounce rate indicates that they perform well and engage visitors and therefore the contents in these pages should be elaborated and copied into other pages.
2.	Organic traffic source should be upscaled followed by paid sources.
3.	Pages with high bounce rate should be investigated to check if they align with users’ expectations.
4.	A sudden spike or drop in page views, session duration or previous visits indicates abnormal activity like a bot attack or sudden viral traffic.
5.	The use of descriptive statistics should be used to spot outliers.
6.	A session duration of 0 or very low values suggests that users didn’t engage with the contents.
